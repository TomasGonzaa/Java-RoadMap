 # Java - Basic Syntax
 In Java programs it's very important to keep in mind the following points:
 ## Case Sensitivity
 Java is case-sensitive, which means that it recognizes whether a name is written in UpperCase or LowerCase.
 For example the identifier `Hello` and `hello` would have diferent meaning in Java.
 #### Class Names
 The first letter of any class name should be in Upper Case. In the case that a name consists in several words, each inner word's first letter should bue also in UpperCase.
 Example class name `Class` or `MyFirstJavaClass`.
 #### Method Names
 All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter, except for the first word, should be in Upper Case.
 Example method name `method()` or `myMethodName()`.
 #### Program File Name
 The name of the program should exactly match the class name.
 #### Java Identifiers
 Identifiers are the names of variables, methods, classes, packages and interfaces.
* All identifiers should begin with an A-Z `letter` (Uppercase or LowerCase), currency character `$` or an underscore `_`.
* A key word cannot be used as an identifier because they have a predefined meaning.
* Examples:
Legal Identifiers: age, $salary, _value, _1_value.
Illegal Identifiers: 123abc, -salary.
#### Java Keywords
These are reserved words and may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.
Examples: abstract, boolean, break, catch, const, default, finally, for, new, etc.
#### Whitespaces
* A whitespace is the term used in Java to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments.
* A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line.
* Whitespaces and blank lines are totally ignored by Java compiler.
#### Comments
Comments are like helping text in your Java program. This are ignored by the compiler.
- **Single-Line Comments**:

        // maybe I can add something here
- **Multi-Line Comments**:

        /* 
        Keep Trying
        You can do this!.
        */
