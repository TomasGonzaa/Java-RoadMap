# Data Structure 
Is a way to store and organize data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data Structures are fundamental to design algorithms and solving complex problems, as they provides the means to manage and manipulate data efficiently.
Java provides built-in data structures and the ability to create custom data structures.
### Types
**1. Linear data structures:** Organize data in a sequential manner.
Examples:
- `Arrays` are fixed-size structure where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- `Linked List` A dinamic structure where each node(element) points to the next.
- `Stack` A "last-in, first-out"(LIFO) structure.
- `Queue` A "firs-in, first-out"(FIFO) structure. Java provides Queue and Deque interfaces.

**2. Non-linear data structures:** Organize data hierarchically or in a network structure.
- `Tree` Hierarchical structure where each node has a parent and zero or more children.
- `Graph` Consisting of nodes(vertices) and edges. Used to represent relationships between entities.

Data structures can be also classified as:
- **Static data structures:** the size is allocated at the compile-time. Therefore the maximum size is fixed.
- **Dinamic data structures:** The size is allocated at the run-time. Therefore maximum size is flexible.

### Common Operations
The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:
1. Searching
2. Sorting
3. Insertion
4. Updation
5. Deletion

### Advantages of data structure
- **Efficiency**: Choose the right data structure to improve the performance of algorithms.
- **Reusability**:  Many Java built-in data structures (like ArrayList, HashMap) provide ready-to-use solutions.
- **Flexibility**: Allows solving a variety of problems, from managing large datasets to implementing complex algorithms.
- **Organization**: Makes it easier to store and retrieve data logically.

### Java Collection Framework (JCF)
 It provides a comprehensive, ready-to-use library of common data structures and algorithms. It simplifies the implementation of data structures, making Java development more efficient and robust.

**Common data structures in JCF:**
- `List` Ordered collection of elements. Allows duplicates.
- `Set` Collection of unique elements. No duplicates allowed.
- `Map` Collection of key-value pairs.
- `Deque` Double-ended queue supporting addition/removal from both ends.
